If everything is ok, you should see a 'Hello world!' message when you go to 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1' on your browser.

By default the application creates an admin user (credentials configurable in .env file).
Using the Lost & found API.postman_collection.json file it is possible to test our API with the following use cases:

- create user with agent,passenger and admin roles (as admin)
- get all users (as admin)
- create products (as admin/agent or passenger)
- get products (as admin/agent or passenger):
    - all products
    - product by Id
    - products by brand or type
    - products lost in a range interval (minLostTime and maxLostTime)
    - products by message (using Full text search)
- delete products (as admin or agent)
